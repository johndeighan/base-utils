Testing Directory Layout
========================

Directory `test`, which exists inside the directory
containing unit tests (also named `test`) includes
these files (all files include a trailing `\n` char):

`file1.txt`:

```text
Hello
```

`file1.zh`:

```text
你好
```

`file2.txt`:

```text
Goodbye
```

`file2.zh`:

```text
再见
```

`file3.txt`:

```text
---
fName: John
lName: Deighan
---

This is a test
```

`test.coffee`:

```coffee
console.log "Hello"
```

Also, `test.js` and `test.js.map` which were generated by
using the CoffeeScript compiler on `test.coffee` with
the `-c` and `-m` options.

Write Recipe
============

A **write recipe** is a list consisting of:

- string - write this line out literally, with a trailing \n
- hash - make callback to `writeLine()` to get line to write
