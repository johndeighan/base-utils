CHANGELOG
=========

Version 15.0.0
--------------

`debug` - works correctly from top level of scripts.

`FileProcessor`

`nice` - provides compact, clear formatting of JavaScript values

Version 16.0.0
--------------

in lib /fs, function allFilesIn() was renamed to allFilesMatching()
to better reflect the meaning of its 1st argument. Unfortunately,
that required a change in major version number.
